# Fabric-OVR-Vulkan

Started from https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr/tree/master/samples/hellovr_vulkan 

Intended to be a project, but may just be a hacking exercise. Trying to make a good boilerplate for a vulkan VR app.

Expects shader and resource folders to be one level above exe right. So may have to copy them into folder.
